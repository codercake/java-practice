It is a REPL language with jshell that was introduced in Java 9 and helps to print a specific statement. Re eval out of loops. 
Java is a statically typed language.
In a local variable, assign the value not in Instance(Global) variable.
Multiple Inheritance is not possible in java due to ambiguity issue.
As the preference is given more to the local variable, it uses the 'this' keyword to denote the current object variable. 

Two types of Polymorphism:
1. Compile-time; specified with params/args.
2. Run-time; not specified with params/args.

Access Modifiers:
1. Public 
2. Private
3. Protected
4. Default

Final keyword:
1. When you make a class final the inheritance ends.
2. Final can be used with a variable, which makes it a constant.
3. Final can be used with a method, which makes it non-overridable. 
4. Final can be used with a class, to ensure that your class can be inherited respectively. 

String pool- changed value, into a string literalin Heap memory.
Change data is called StringBuffer, thread-safe process

Types of Errors:
1. Compile-time errors
2. Logical errors
3. Runtime errors, exceeded the runtime limit 

Exceptions:
IOException - use Try Catch, throws IOException
1. Checked
2. Unchecked - Compiler won't check basically ignore them.
